      <p>
        To ensure members of the University of Michigan community—whether on
        a tight budget or physically restrained from getting to a grocery
        store—receive equitable access to healthy, nutritious, and nourishing food
        and the ability to prepare it for themselves or others. Check out the
        <a href="https://mbc.studentlife.umich.edu/">CAPS </a> website for more information.
